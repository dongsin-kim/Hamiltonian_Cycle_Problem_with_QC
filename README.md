# Hamiltonian_Cycle_Problem_with_QC

### Finding Efficient Solution for Hamiltonian Cycle (NP-complete Problem)

[issue #22](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-hackathon-korea-21/issues/22)

This project is to try multiple approaches to sovle Hamiltonian cycle problem (HCP) and compare the results.

- The first approach: Define HCP as QUBO and apply Quantum optimization algorithm.

- The second approach: Apply Grover's iteration to solve HCP.
